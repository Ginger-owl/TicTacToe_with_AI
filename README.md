# TicTacToe_with_AI python
Command line version of a Tic-Tac-Toe game.
To try it out copy the code and run in your console.

There is a starting menu in the game to initialize the game and choose the opponent.

One may play either to another person ("user" - "user" game) or against the bot.
There are three levels of difficulty: "easy", "medium" and "hard".

The most interesting one is the hard level, because in this mode programm picks positions for the moves based on the Minimax algorithm.


This project was created initially on a platfom JetBrains Academy (HyperSkill) as a part of Python Core course.
