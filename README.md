# TicTacToe_with_AI
Command line version of Tic-Tac-Toe game.
There is a starting menu in the game to initialize the game and choose the opponent.

One may play either to another person (user - user game) or against the programm.
There are three levels of difficult: easy, medium and hard.

The most interesting one is the hard level, because in this mode programm picks positions for the moves based on the minimax algorithm.
